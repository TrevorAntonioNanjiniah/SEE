# 📝 README - Fun Calculator 🎉

## 🚀 Overview
This is a **Fun Calculator** that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two user-provided numbers. It's written in Python and includes playful comments to make coding more enjoyable! 😊

## ✨ Features
- ➕ **Addition** - Adds two numbers
- ➖ **Subtraction** - Subtracts the second number from the first
- ✖️ **Multiplication** - Multiplies two numbers
- ➗ **Division** - Divides the first number by the second (handles decimals)
- 😎 **User-friendly input/output** - Simple prompts and clear results

## ⚙️ How to Use
1. **Run the script** in a Python environment:
   ```sh
   python fun_calculator.py
   ```
2. **Enter two numbers** when prompted (supports decimals!).
3. **See the results** instantly! 🎉

## 📋 Example
```sh
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 2

Results of your two numbers:
Sum: 12.0          ➕
Difference: 8.0    ➖
Product: 20.0      ✖️
Quotient: 5.0      ➗
```

## ⚠️ Note
- ❗ **Division by zero** will crash the program (for now! 😅). Future updates may include error handling.

## 🛠️ Future Improvements
- [ ] Add error handling for division by zero 🛡️
- [ ] Support more operations (exponents, modulus, etc.) 🔢
- [ ] Add a loop for continuous calculations 🔄
